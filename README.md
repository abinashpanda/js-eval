# js-eval

`js-eval` is a simple JavaScript evaluator that can be used to evaluate JavaScript expressions. This is a hobby project that I am working on to learn how to build a parser, lexer and hopefully a compiler.

> **Note:** This project is still in its early stages and is not yet ready for use.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run all the tests:

```bash
bun test --watch
```
